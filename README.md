# [TNT Map Editor]

TNT stands for Top and Tile map editor. This is an open source tile-map-editor I created to help me out put out some maps fast.

Feel free to use it as you like.

## Quick start

### It currently supports:
 * Import of JSON as exported by it.
 * Export of JSON bases on the names of the tile images e.x (corner.png will become corner in the json)
 * Load of a sample Map for quickstart
 * Load extra items along with tiles
 * Load custom tiles from Dropbox

### Future features support
 * Save map to local-storage
 * Auto save
 * Paint tiles with mouse-move
