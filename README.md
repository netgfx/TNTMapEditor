# [TNT Map Editor]

TNT stands for Top and Tile map editor. This is an open source tile-map-editor I created to help me out put out some maps fast.

Feel free to use it as you like.

## Quick start

** It currently supports:
 -> Import of JSON as exported by it.
 -> Export of JSON bases on the names of the tile images e.x (corner.png will become corner in the json)
 -> Load of a sample Map for quickstart
 -> Load extra items along with tiles

## Future features support
-> Alter map size
-> Load custom tiles from Dropbox
-> Save map to local-storage
-> Auto save
-> Paint tiles with mouse-move
